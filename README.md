## Retrofit + LiveData + Dagger2 in a MVVM + Clean Architecture
This project shows how you can create an Android app using Retrofit, Android architecture component Livedata, Dagger2 to write code using a Model-View-ViewModel pattern implementing Clean Architecture

## Motivation
The motivation behind the project was the lack of a concrete example of using Retrofit2+Dagger2+LiveData without any RxJava in order to achieve an MVVM pattern. This is a very simple straight-forward example involving 2 difference webservice calls. **The work on Clean Architure is in progress. Feel free to fork and contribute to make this project better**

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. - 

## Code style
